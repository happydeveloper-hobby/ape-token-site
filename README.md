PART 1
Initial website
Although I would like to eventually feature both BSC and ERC tokens, to make it simpler I
think we should start only with BSC tokens. ERC tokens can be added later.
1) The first task is to create a similar website to PooCoin, that needs to show:• Token information (name, price, swap pair)
• Supply details, Liquidity Pool information
• TradingView graph (candles etc)
• A basic search function to find/query other contracts
• List of holders
• Recent tx history
• Current token price
• Links to BscScan contract/transactions/holders pages.
